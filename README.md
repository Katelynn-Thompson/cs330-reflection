Designing Software
During this course my approach to designing my 3D scene and software was to be structured and iterative, focusing on balancing functionality with aesthetics. This project enhanced my skills in 3D scene composition and user interaction, following a process of prototyping and refining. These tactics will be crucial for maintaining flexibility and adaptability in future work.
Developing Programs
I emphasize modularity and iterative development in my programming. I utilized custom functions and continuous testing to keep this project's code organized and functional. My approach evolved through each milestone, making me more proactive in problem-solving and optimization.
Reaching My Goals Through Computer Science
This project has not only reinforced but also deepened my understanding of the importance of computer science in achieving my career goals. The skills in computational graphics I've gained are not just valuable, but essential for my educational and professional pathways, enabling me to create more interactive and engaging digital experiences.
